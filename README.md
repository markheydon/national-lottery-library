# national-lottery-library

**NO LONGER USED** Was originally used as part of https://github.com/markheydon/national-lottery-generator but code now merged into the app directly and this library abandoned.

PHP library that makes an attempt at 'guessing' the Lotto numbers using a half-arsed bit of logic.
